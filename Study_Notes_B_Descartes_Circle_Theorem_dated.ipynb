        "This series of Colab notebooks contains study notes related to Descartes' Circle Theorem. The motivation for this work originated from attending Professor Peter Sarnak's Shaw Prize Lecture in Mathematical Sciences in 2024. Not only does his lecture begin with Descartes' Circle Theorem, but he also provides significant insights into the importance of establishing a \"base\" for one’s long-term endeavors. Reflecting on his remarks, I believe that exploring mathematical concepts through Python code could serve as my \"base,\" drawing from prior experiences; thus, I produced this series of Colab notebooks. Some of the code comes from iterative collaboration with DeepSeek, representing an experiment that integrates traditional mathematical mindsets with contemporary computational methodologies.\n",

Moreover, inversion is involutory, now one can simple use inversion in $C$ again, map $C_{4+}'$ to $C_{4+}$ and map $C_{4-}'$ to $C_{4-}$. Since inversion preserves incidence, both $C_{4+}$ and $C_{4-}$ are tangential to $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$ simultaneously. One can then do some exercise to compute and verify the symmetric relation of curvature in the Descartes' Circle Theorem.\n",
